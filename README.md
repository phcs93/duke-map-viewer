# Dukefy
A tool for viewing Duke Nukem 3D maps.

This project is a fragment of an older, bigger project intended to be a Duke Nukem 3D launcher with support for xDuke, hDuke and nDuke. It had a lot of network features like a P2P chat and geolocalization. And of course, launching the game to start a multiplayer dukematch. I've ended up focusing a lot more on the map preview feature, on which later I converted into this web project.

:gift: You can find some of my own maps in the "res/maps" folder.
