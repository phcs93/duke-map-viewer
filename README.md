# DEMO
https://phcs93.github.io/duke-map-viewer/

# TO-DO

- show map crc
- show reg maps (separate folder)
- option to toggle lines
- option to toggle effectors
- option to toggle hitags and lotags (figure out how to render it just like mapster)

- map filtering
  - consider netduke32 ctf/tdm maps -> check how its done
  - filter maps by port specific only (eduke/netduke/nduke/produke)

- sprites
  - render spawn angle
  - render player 1

- map rating
  - this would require a server of some sort
    - maybe a better ideia is to "classify" some known maps, for example:
      - arenas
      - maps full of secrets (fran maps)
      - good balanced maps for DM (roch, etc)
      - garbage maps (unplayable maps with no items or just plain empty rooms)
      - etc...
